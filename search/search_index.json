The current version we are using is 15.2.0 , it can be downloaded directly here: nRF5_SDK_v15.2.0_9412b96.zip Extract the zip file into the base-dock/nrf_sdks/ directory. This should give you the following folder structure: ./base-dock \u251c\u2500\u2500 LICENSE.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 config \u251c\u2500\u2500 docs \u251c\u2500\u2500 examples \u251c\u2500\u2500 external \u251c\u2500\u2500 material \u251c\u2500\u2500 mkdocs.yml \u2514\u2500\u2500 nrf_sdks \u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md \u2514\u2500\u2500 nRF5_SDK_15.2.0_9412b96 Install GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain Download and install a GNU ARM Embedded build for your operating system and extract it on your file system. Note The current version we are using is 6-2017-q2-update . Config the toolchain path in makefile.windows or makefile.posix depending on platform you are using. That is, the .posix should be edited if your are working on either Linux or macOS. These files are located in: nRF5 SDK /components/toolchain/gcc Open the file in a text editor and make sure that the GNU_INSTALL_ROOT variable is pointing to your GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain install directory. For example: GNU_INSTALL_ROOT : = $( HOME ) /gcc-arm-none-eabi/gcc-arm-none-eabi-6-2017-q2-update/bin/ GNU_VERSION : = 6 .3.1 GNU_PREFIX : = arm-none-eabi Build and Run an Example Next, you can build the examples provided with the base-dock repo. The following steps show how to build and run the ble_app_blinky example: Navigate to the example directory: # For nRF52832-MDK board $ cd ./base-dock/examples/ble_app_blinky/nrf52832_mdk/armgcc # For nRF52840-MDK board $ cd ./base-dock/examples/ble_app_blinky/nrf52840_mdk/armgcc Connect nRF52832-MDK or nRF52840-MDK to your PC Build the example and flash to the board $ make flash_all Open nRF Connect App and start scanning, a device called Nordic_Blinky will be found! Connect Nordic_Blinky device, and start to test the LED and Button service. The device can be powered by the AA battery after removing the USB cable!
